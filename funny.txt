Hello everyone, my name is Rohan Thokchom and I am from India.
Yes, I know the disbelief.
'A Chinese pretending to be Indian.'
I get that a lot, even in my own country.
Actually, I am from the east part of India and people in that reson have a Mongolian face. So, yeah we look different from the mainland people in India.
Infact, all Indian are not the same. 
A typical stereotype of an Indian person is a brown guy that works in an IT company. 
When you go down south, the skin tone gets darker and when you go north vice-versa.
And then there's us, we are like the Black People in America.
You know what I will tell you how.
Most of the sportmen in India are from North East of India.
Football 80% of the people are from our state. We get racium all the time.
But there is one thing that makes us different from Black people and that thing is very unique.
You all know it...Hell even I can't say it.
We don't call ourselves chinkies, momo,etc..
Any of that is a cool name. What if I say, what's up my momo or what's up my chinkie.
Thank you
